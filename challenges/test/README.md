### Reverse an Array

Take in an array and then return it in reversed order.

#### Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Approach & Efficiency

I took a for a loop approach while filling up a new array, as for the big 0 idk, fast i  guess?

### Add a value into the middle of an array

Puts something in the middle of arrray.

#### Challenge

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added.

#### Approach & Efficiency

It's efficient as it wil get, depends on how big the array is that gets put in the args

#### Solution

### Finding a Matching value using binary search

Find the matching int in an array using binary search technique.

#### Challenge  

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element.  

#### Approach & Efficiency  

The time needed to take scales with the space as it depends how big the array is, but the efficiency is insane since it take less steps to find the matching number than in an for loop.
